# NAB Digital Technology

Regarding to digital strategy of National Australian Bank (NAB), the word “digital” was first appeared in the 2012 annual financial report. Since 2012, NAB has generally focused on implementing digital technologies in order to improve their customers’ experiences. We are going to illustrate those digital technologies grouping by four main aspects mentioned previously in timeline.

#### Integrated Platforms

In 2013, NAB took aim at mobile banking. Seeing the incredibly growth in smartphone and tablet market, NAB determined to develop their digital wallet which enabled users to upload their cards and use it with their smartphone (Smith, 2013). With the implementation of NFC chips on the smartphone, customers can tap the smartphone instead of physical cards to finish the paying process. 

In 2014, during the Adobe Digital Marketing Symposium in Sydney, statistics showed that NAB is the leading bank of digital content, digital and direct bank in Australia (O'Brien, 2014). NAB has built up a new website management platform. providing faster online response and right digital business tools over the past 18 months. Considering the importance and need of the core banking platform, NAB has integrated the technology which was provided by Adobe into their new banking platform so as to improve the experiences of customers. Customers were no longer have to go to the bank since a wide range of services can be finished online such as complete a transaction process.  They thought such digital transformation was able to lead their business in the future market. 

In those two years, NAB was focusing on integrating their digital platform and providing customers with better user experience as well as efficiency improvement. Integrated platform can accelerate most of the legacy business process and increase the productivity level of the customer services. With the fast growing adoption and penetration of mobile phone, mobile banking has also been proven its importance. Small and efficient digital platform such as smartphone is the trend for banking service since it save the time for going to bank and many other advantages. It would benefit the banking service in the long run due to its flexibility and efficiency. 

####  Big Data

In 2015, NAB roll out a robo advisers, which is an online computer-generated advice platform, to help to achieve the real-time response (Conroy, 2015). It can provide personalized tips on super and insurance, with NAB planning to expand the product to cover debt, cash flow, investments and estate planning. To in line with customers’ current state and activate the relationship between customer and bank adviser, robo advisers are able to provide extensive business service support. In this case, robo advisers can optimize the labor resources and also provides more detailed and persuasive services support to their customers. 

In 2016, NAB launched the QuickBiz Loan which is using machine learning algorithm for automated business lending to new small business. By using big data analytic technology, it can deliver smoother and better customer experience as it doesn't require customer to provide any extra information.

AI and Big Data are currently the hottest topics both in research and industry. It is worth spending capital on it for the sake of business automation. According to Mr Thorburn, NAB is taking advantages of AI and cloud. It is going to deliver $1 billion cost savings from increasingly intelligent automation. Intelligent services are more reliable than human decision making due to the large amount of data analysis. In future banking industry, AI would play a very imperative role since it is able to discover the hidden value among the data which may worth billions.

#### Strategic Collaborationes

In 2017, NAB was considering the future of banking industry. Besides providing the basic banking service, NAB hope to diversify their functions by creating an ecosystem with the power and influence of Facebook (Boyd, 2017). By breaking the limitation of traditional banking, NAB Digital tried to develop new products and services that can penetrate into customers’ daily life and help them to gain better experiences with the services they were about to provide. With the growth of users, they are able to have more data for machine learning algorithm and big data services to analyze and use the results to better locate their customers’ needs. 

Nowadays, people are spending lots of time on social media and social media generally replaces most of the traditional information channel. By cooperating with the Facebook, NAB is able to attract more customers from social media by increasing its exposure in a very short time. Via the scaling up customer base by network effects, NAB can segment their customers in different groups and provide targeting service for each different group of customers. The direct network effect of social media can also bring lots of customers for NAB in return due to the Metcalfe’s law. In the long run, the ecosystem will have better customized function and service for each customer and increase the region connectivity.  

#### Digital Resource Deployment

In 2018, NAB has begun a trial on AI-powered facial recognition ATMs and it has been demonstrated at the SIBOS conference in Sydney. It enable the customers to withdraw cash without a card or a phone (Smith, 2018). The ATM integrating with Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, along with its face recognition service. NAB hopes to change the way people use ATMs and build up a faster and efficient way of this service. This approach can be also against the fraudulent user of stolen cards and card skimming. The security level would increase to the next level if the AI facial recognition technology is able to excellence and perfect itself. 

NAB has also invested a lot on basic technology infrastructure such as service centre and data warehouse. By replacing the old data warehouse, the new one has more capability and powerful computing resource to handle the current massive data flow and to ensure all the banking process can function well and safe. It also enhances the real-time processing ability to make sure messages are exchanged as soon as possible without delay.

Even though it is a trial, we are able to see the future of ATMs banking. As I mentioned above, AI is currently everywhere around the world. To make us, NAB would benefit from it by increasing its banking efficiency and effectiveness in their daily routines. It can reduce the cost in the long run by automating the banking services. This new and cutting-edge technology would able to increasing its competitiveness and has potentials to outperform the others in banking industry. Moreover, it is also essential to update the hardware infrastructure to make sure the banking process won't be able to affected by technical problems since we cannot afford the lost.
