# L1 Introduction

### Strategy

- Finding a way to accomplish one's ends
- Moving from a current position to a more desirable future position but with economies of time, effort, cost, or resource utilization

### Business Strategy

- Three essential elements:
  - A diagnosis based on forecasting and/or environmental scanning
  - A Guiding Policy (may be driven by a clearly expressed vision) specifies an approach to dealing with critical challenges
  - Coherent actions (resource commitments, and other concrete steps guided by the policy) aimed at achieving **sustainable competitive advantage**

- Set-of managerial decisions and actions that determines the long-run performance of a corporation
- emphasizes the monitoring and evaluating of external opportunities and threats in light of the organization's strengths and weaknesses
- includes environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implementation, and evaluation and control

### IT Strategy

- IT strategy (information technology strategy) is a comprehensive plan that outlines how technology should be used to meet IT and business goals.
- An IT strategy is typically a written document that details the multiple actions and resource deployments that affect the organization's investment in and use of information technology(eg. Digital strategy)

- key concerns:
  - Most importantly, alignment with business strategy
  - Contemporary concerns, digital disruption/digital transformation
  - Key technologies, cloud computing, big data (turning big data into critical insights and action etc.)

### Business Strategy -- IT Strategy Alignment

- IT is changing our understanding of:
  - Markets
  - Industries
  - Strategies
- Before: Back-office support in the basement
- Now: an embedded part of business strategies
- Successful management of IT is necessary for competitive advantage
- Information Technology (IT) has been a source of opportunity and uncertainty, of advantage and risk
- The chasm in organizations:
  - Business executives: What do these tech nerds know about business?
  - IT executives: They don’t know what’s going on out there. No vision at all! (Lacking the vision to exploit all that technology has to offer)
  - Both struggle as they attempt to implement increasingly complex systems in the face of rapid change in business and technology
- Dual Objectives:
  - Help business executives recognize the potential of technology in creating business advantage
  - Help IT executives assume the leadership positions, to define and execute both technology and business strategy.

  - **Strategic alliance** –Partnership of two or more corporations to achieve strategically significant objectives that are mutually beneficial
    - When two or more firms agree to cooperate for their mutual benefit
    - Possible reasons/benefits:
      - Obtain technology or manufacturing capabilities

### Corporate Strategy

- the choice of direction for the firm as a whole
- deals with three key issues:

  - Portfolio strategy - the industries or markets in which the firm competes through its products and business units
  - Parenting strategy - the manner in which management coordinates activities, transfers resources and cultivates capabilities among product lines and business units

#### Directional Strategy

- deals with the company's orientation towards growth

- Composed of three general orientations:

  - **Growth** Strategies expand the company's activities

    - Concentration on current product lines in one industry

      - Vertical Growth
        - taking over a function previously provided by a supplier or by a distributor
        - Can be achieved by expanding current operations or through acquisitions
        - Result in **Vertical Integration**
          - The degree to which a firm operates vertically in multiple locations on an industry’s value chain
            - Backward integration
            - Forward Integration

      - Horizontal Growth
        - Extending products into other geographic locations
        - Increasing the range of products and services it offers to current markets.
      - Internal Growth
        - Expand operation globally and domestically
      - External Growth
        - Through merges, acquisition ion and strategic alliances

    - Diversification into other product lines in other industries

      - Concentric (同心)
        - Related industry
        - uses the firm's competencies and resources
        - Search Information system for synergy(协同效应)
          - two business will generate more profits together than they cold separately
          - companies attain synergy through transferring knowledge and market intelligence, sharing resources and combining operations
      - Conglomerate (集团)
        - unrelated industry
        - uses the firm's financial or managerial assets

  - **Stability** Strategies make no change to the company's current activities

    - A corporation may choose stability over growth by continuing its current activities without any significant change in direction.
    - Although sometimes viewed as a lack of strategy, the stability family of corporate strategies can be appropriate for a successful corporation operating in a reasonably predictable environment.
    - Stability strategies can be very useful in the **short run**, but they can be dangerous if followed for too long.

  - **Retrenchment** strategies reduce the company's level of activities 

    - A company may pursue retrenchment strategies when it has a weak competitive position in some or all of its product lines, resulting in poor performance -- sales are down and profits are becoming losses

#### Portfolio Strategy -- Portfolio Analysis

- Used to develop corporate strategy in a diversified firm to boost overall corporate performance
- Framework for charting the different businesses in a firm

    - Stars: High relative share / Able to generate cash
    - Question marks: Low relative share in growing markets / Requires cash for development
      - with uncertain or weak future prospects should be divested

#### Parenting Strategy -- Corporate Parenting

- Views the corporation in terms of resources and capabilities that can be used to build business unit value as well as generate synergies across business units

# L5 Technological Forecasting

- Definition: The prediction of the invention, timing, trajectory, characteristics, performance, or rate of diffusion of a machine, material, technique, or process (or combination thereof) to serve some useful purpose.

  - Difficult to make sound strategic decisions w/o some consideration of the future trajectories of key technologies
  - One of the approaches to ‘scanning the environment’
  - Help anticipate emerging tech changes
  - Enables organizations think thru alternative scenarios
  - Help plan for future technology needs

- Key stages in tech forecasting

  - framing the problem
  - gathering and analyzing the data using a variety of methodologies
  - Interpreting the results and assembling the forecast/stories based on the available information

- Assumptions reg. the future in forecasting

  - Extrapolation (预测未来走向) - future is a logical extrapolation of the past
  - Future is too complex to get it right thru statistical and trend analyses - need to rely on expert/human judgment
  - Pattern Analysis
  - Contrarian

- Forecast performance

  - Accuracy (useful but not the only consideration)
  - Actionability
  - Reducing surprises

- Planning for the future

  - Trend extrapolation
    - Extension of present trends into the future
    - Assumes that the world is consistent and changes slowly

- **Delphi Method**

  - involves asking a group of experts to provide forecasts and projections and their comments and rationale

  - The forecasts and comments are circulated among all the experts for a second round and asked if they would like to revise their forecasts and comments based on the inputs

  - This process can continue for a few rounds until some kind of consensus emerges – possible convergence

  - advantage:

    - Anonymity, reduce the effects of groupthink
    - relatively cheap
    - does not require the experts to meet physically
    - can address a variety of topics

    - can develop a reasonable sense of the rationale behind the forecasts

- Scenario Planning

  - it is a method of **preparing** for the future regardless of what happens. But **NOT** a method for predicting the future. Enable better decisions making.

  - When

    - Uncertainty is high
    - Too many costly surprises occurred in the past
    - Few new opportunities exist
    - Significant change occurred in industry or will occur
    - Strong differences of opinion exist concerning the future

  - How

    - stage 1: Key focal issue

      - identify a focal(焦点) issue
      - Set time frame
      - set scope of analysis (in terms of products,markets,geographic areas and technologies)

    - stage 2: Driving forces identification

      - major categories of drivers
        - social
        - economic
        - political
        - technology

    - stage 3: Scenario Framework

        - Select two most important uncertainties
      - Check for consistency and plausibility
        - Must be very low correlation between pair of uncertainties

      ![Capture](C:\Users\user\Desktop\Capture.PNG)

    - stage 4: From scenarios to options

      - develop implications
        - return to the key focal issue
