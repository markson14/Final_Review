# L1 Introduction

### Strategy

- Finding a way to accomplish one's ends
- Moving from a current position to a more desirable future position but with economies of time, effort, cost, or resource utilization

### Business Strategy

- Three essential elements:
  - A diagnosis based on forecasting and/or environmental scanning
  - A Guiding Policy (may be driven by a clearly expressed vision) specifies an approach to dealing with critical challenges
  - Coherent actions (resource commitments, and other concrete steps guided by the policy) aimed at achieving **sustainable competitive advantage**

- Set-of managerial decisions and actions that determines the long-run performance of a corporation
- emphasizes the monitoring and evaluating of external opportunities and threats in light of the organization's strengths and weaknesses
- includes environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implementation, and evaluation and control

### IT Strategy

- IT strategy (information technology strategy) is a comprehensive plan that outlines how technology should be used to meet IT and business goals.
- An IT strategy is typically a written document that details the multiple actions and resource deployments that affect the organization's investment in and use of information technology(eg. Digital strategy)

- key concerns:
  - Most importantly, alignment with business strategy
  - Contemporary concerns, digital disruption/digital transformation
  - Key technologies, cloud computing, big data (turning big data into critical insights and action etc.)

### Business Strategy -- IT Strategy Alignment

- IT is changing our understanding of:
  - Markets
  - Industries
  - Strategies
- Before: Back-office support in the basement
- Now: an embedded part of business strategies
- Successful management of IT is necessary for competitive advantage
- Information Technology (IT) has been a source of opportunity and uncertainty, of advantage and risk
- The chasm in organizations:
  - Business executives: What do these tech nerds know about business?
  - IT executives: They don’t know what’s going on out there. No vision at all! (Lacking the vision to exploit all that technology has to offer)
  - Both struggle as they attempt to implement increasingly complex systems in the face of rapid change in business and technology
- Dual Objectives:
  - Help business executives recognize the potential of technology in creating business advantage
  - Help IT executives assume the leadership positions, to define and execute both technology and business strategy.

# L2 General Strategies

### General Strategies

- Corporate Strategies
  - Directional Strategies
  - Portfolio Strategies
  - Parenting Strategies
- Business Strategies
  - Competitive Strategies
  - Cooperative Strategies
- Functional Strategies
  - Action plans for each functional area

### Business Strategy

- Focuses on improving the competitive position of a company's products or services within the specific industry or market segment that the company serves

- **Competitive**
  - **Battling against all competitors for advantage**
  - Porter’s Generic Competitive Strategies
  - A firm’s relative position within its industry positioning determines whether a firm’s profitability is above or below industry average
  - The competitive strategies made up of:
    - Two types of generic competitive advantage –low cost or differentiation
    - Scope of activities –cost focus or differentiation focus
  - Firm must make a choice
- **Cooperative**
  - **Working with one or more companies to gain advantage against other competitors**
  - Collusion
    - the active cooperation of firms within an industry to reduce output and raise prices to avoid economic law of supply and demand
  - **Strategic alliance** –Partnership of two or more corporations to achieve strategically significant objectives that are mutually beneficial
    - When two or more firms agree to cooperate for their mutual benefit
    - Possible reasons/benefits:
      - Obtain technology or manufacturing capabilities
        - Tesla and Toyota’s deal to develop an electric RAV4 sport-utility vehicle has fizzled(2014, May)
        - Tesla CEO says could sign new deal with Toyota in 2-3 years(2014 Sep)
      - Obtain access to specific markets
      - Share risks and expenses
      - Achieve or ensure competitive advantage
  - **Types of alliances**:
    - Mutual service consortium
      - **Pooling resources to gain a benefit that is too expensive to develop alone**
    - Joint venture
      - **Two or more separate organizations creates an independent business entity**
        - GE, Intel to form new healthcare joint venture, 2010
        - Extremely popular in international undertakings
          - E.g. ChanganFord Automobile. Co., Ltd.
        - Disadvantages of joint ventures include loos of control, lower profits, probability of conflicts with partners, and the likely transfer of technological advantage to the partner.
    - Licensing arrangement
      - **Licensing firm grants rights to another firm to produce / sell a product**
        - The licensee pays compensation to the licensing firm in return for technical expertise
      - contractual arrangement whereby one organization obtains the rights to use the proprietary technology of another organization
      - benefits for licensees:
        - less expensive
        - rapidly acquire a technology it does not possess
      - benefits for licensors:
        - technology can penetrate a wider market
        - preempt(抢占，防止) competitors from developing their own competing technologies
    - Value-chain partnership
      - **long-term arrangement with key supplier or distributor for mutual advantage**

### Corporate Strategy

- the choice of direction for the firm as a whole
- deals with three key issues:
  - Directional strategy - the firm's overall orientation toward growth, stability or retrenchment
  - Portfolio strategy - the industries or markets in which the firm competes through its products and business units
  - Parenting strategy - the manner in which management coordinates activities, transfers resources and cultivates capabilities among product lines and business units

#### Directional Strategy

- deals with the company's orientation towards growth

- Composed of three general orientations:

  - **Growth** Strategies expand the company's activities

    - Concentration on current product lines in one industry

      - Vertical Growth
        - taking over a function previously provided by a supplier or by a distributor
        - Can be achieved by expanding current operations or through acquisitions
        - Result in **Vertical Integration**
          - The degree to which a firm operates vertically in multiple locations on an industry’s value chain
            - Backward integration
            - Forward Integration

      - Horizontal Growth
        - Extending products into other geographic locations
        - Increasing the range of products and services it offers to current markets.
      - Internal Growth
        - Expand operation globally and domestically
      - External Growth
        - Through merges, acquisition ion and strategic alliances

    - Diversification into other product lines in other industries

      - Concentric (同心)
        - Related industry
        - uses the firm's competencies and resources
        - Search Information system for synergy(协同效应)
          - two business will generate more profits together than they cold separately
          - companies attain synergy through transferring knowledge and market intelligence, sharing resources and combining operations
      - Conglomerate (集团)
        - unrelated industry
        - uses the firm's financial or managerial assets

  - **Stability** Strategies make no change to the company's current activities

    - A corporation may choose stability over growth by continuing its current activities without any significant change in direction.
    - Although sometimes viewed as a lack of strategy, the stability family of corporate strategies can be appropriate for a successful corporation operating in a reasonably predictable environment.
    - Stability strategies can be very useful in the **short run**, but they can be dangerous if followed for too long.

  - **Retrenchment** strategies reduce the company's level of activities 

    - A company may pursue retrenchment strategies when it has a weak competitive position in some or all of its product lines, resulting in poor performance -- sales are down and profits are becoming losses

#### Portfolio Strategy -- Portfolio Analysis

- Used to develop corporate strategy in a diversified firm to boost overall corporate performance
- Framework for charting the different businesses in a firm
- Classic tool for analysis
  - BCG Growth-Share Matrix
    - Cash cows: Produces cash that can be used to fund other businesses
      - support question marks and stars
    - Dogs: Low market share and potential
      - sold off or managed carefully
    - Stars: High relative share / Able to generate cash
    - Question marks: Low relative share in growing markets / Requires cash for development
      - with uncertain or weak future prospects should be divested

#### Parenting Strategy -- Corporate Parenting

- Views the corporation in terms of resources and capabilities that can be used to build business unit value as well as generate synergies across business units
- Generates corporate strategy by focusing on core competencies of the parent and on the value created from the relationship between the parent and its businesses
- Developing a Corporate Parenting Strategy
  - Examine each business unit/product line in terms of its strategic factors
  - Examine each business unit/product line in terms of areas in which performance can be improved
  - Analyze how well the parent corporation fits with the business unit

# L5 Technological Forecasting

- Definition: The prediction of the invention, timing, trajectory, characteristics, performance, or rate of diffusion of a machine, material, technique, or process (or combination thereof) to serve some useful purpose.

  - Difficult to make sound strategic decisions w/o some consideration of the future trajectories of key technologies
  - One of the approaches to ‘scanning the environment’
  - Help anticipate emerging tech changes
  - Enables organizations think thru alternative scenarios
  - Help plan for future technology needs

- Key stages in tech forecasting

  - framing the problem
  - gathering and analyzing the data using a variety of methodologies
  - Interpreting the results and assembling the forecast/stories based on the available information

- Assumptions reg. the future in forecasting

  - Extrapolation (预测未来走向) - future is a logical extrapolation of the past
  - Future is too complex to get it right thru statistical and trend analyses - need to rely on expert/human judgment
  - Pattern Analysis
  - Contrarian

- Forecast performance

  - Accuracy (useful but not the only consideration)
  - Actionability
  - Reducing surprises

- Planning for the future

  - Trend extrapolation
    - Extension of present trends into the future
    - Assumes that the world is consistent and changes slowly
  - Judgmental/intuitive methods
    - Knowledgeable people propose ideas
      - Delphi Method/Expert opinion
    - Experts attempt to forecast likely developments
  - Statistical modelling
    - Discover causal or explanatory factors
  - Scenario Planning

- **Delphi Method**

  - involves asking a group of experts to provide forecasts and projections and their comments and rationale

  - The forecasts and comments are circulated among all the experts for a second round and asked if they would like to revise their forecasts and comments based on the inputs

  - This process can continue for a few rounds until some kind of consensus emerges – possible convergence

  - advantage:

    - Anonymity, reduce the effects of groupthink
    - relatively cheap
    - does not require the experts to meet physically
    - can address a variety of topics

    - can develop a reasonable sense of the rationale behind the forecasts

- Scenario Planning

  - it is a method of **preparing** for the future regardless of what happens. But **NOT** a method for predicting the future. Enable better decisions making.

  - When

    - Uncertainty is high
    - Too many costly surprises occurred in the past
    - Few new opportunities exist
    - Significant change occurred in industry or will occur
    - Strong differences of opinion exist concerning the future

  - How

    - stage 1: Key focal issue

      - identify a focal(焦点) issue
      - Set time frame
      - set scope of analysis (in terms of products,markets,geographic areas and technologies)

    - stage 2: Driving forces identification

      - major categories of drivers
        - social
        - economic
        - political
        - technology

    - stage 3: Scenario Framework

      - Construct scenarios
        - Select two most important uncertainties
      - Check for consistency and plausibility
        - Must be very low correlation between pair of uncertainties

      ![Capture](C:\Users\user\Desktop\Capture.PNG)

    - stage 4: From scenarios to options

      - develop implications
        - return to the key focal issue
        - place the organization within each scenario
        - identify strengths and vulnerabilities
      - develop options
        - to address gaps in capabilities
        - further research requirements, necessary actions
        - critical decisions and choices

# L6 Technology Adoption and Diffusion

- To formulate an effective technology strategy, one need to understand the patterns of customer adoption and technology diffusion

  - To figure out the likely distribution of adopters
  - to follow particular strategies to transition from innovators to the majority of the market
  - To accurately forecast the growth of demand

- Distribution of adopters

  - Adoption: the decision of customers to purchase a new product or service
  - Normal distribution is the most common pattern of adoption of new technology products and services
    - early markets
      - innovators: advertising not necessary
      - early adopters: not price-sensitive
    - mainstream markets
      - early majority: advertising is necessary
      - late majority: price-sensitive
    - late market
      - laggards

- Crossing the Chasm

  - transition to the majority of the market
    - needed to achieve an adequate return on investment
    - differences in the adoption decisions of early adopters and the majority of the market
  - how
    - show the value
    - develop a complete solution to customers’ problems
    - pursue a vertical marketing strategy rather than a horizontal marketing strategy
    - segment the early majority of the market and focus on a niche whose needs are not well met (Beachhead strategy)

- forecasting demand

  - determine how much to produce
  - project your costs in businesses based on economies of scale
  - determine the payback on your investment in product development
  - make pricing and advertising decisions
  - determine the competitiveness of the market

- information diffusion models

  - **diffusion** is the rate at which a new tech product becomes adopted by potential users
  - the functional form of diffusion is primarily a result of the distribution of innovators and imitators
    - innovators
    - imitators: 模仿者
  - S-shaped pattern of market growth (sigmoid函数类似的增长): few innovator, many imitators
  - Convex curve: many innovator, few imitators

- The Bass Model

  - a quantitative tool for forecasting the diffusion of new tech products that many companies use

  - based on the size of the market (m), the rate of adoption by innovators(p) and imitators(q), and the cumulative number of adopters in the previous time periods($n_{t-1}$) 
    $$
    St=[p+(q/m)n_{t-1}](m-n_{t-1})
    $$

  - can be modified to include a variety of factors that affect the diffusion of new tech products

  - most accurate at predicting the diffusion of consumer durables

  - Limitations:

    - Accuracy of predictions depends on the acc of assessments of size of the potential market
    - assumes that the diffusion of a tech product depend on only demand-side factors
    - further away in time from the initial adoption point, the acc declines

- functional strategy

  - approach taken by a functional area to achieve corporate and business unit objectives and strategies
  - directed at improving effectiveness of basic operations, such as marketing, R&D, HR, etc.
  - Involves:
    - Maximizing resource productivity
    - Developing distinctive competency
  - We will focus on tech/ R&D strategy and IS/IT strategy

# L7 Platform Strategy

- platform: to characterize product, services, firm or institutions that mediate transaction between two or more group of agent
- digital platform
  - enablers
    - the evolution of the internet
    - connecting tech
    - globalization
  - less requirement on physical infrastructure and assets
  - easy to scale up
  - players
    - external
      - producers: creators of the platform’s offerings (apps developer)
      - consumers
    - internal
      - providers: interfaces for the platform
      - owner
- “pipeline” business
  - create value by controlling a linear series of activities – the classic value-chain model. inputs at one end of the chain undergo a series of steps that transform them into an output that’s worth more: the finished products
- from pipeline to platform
  - from resource control to resource orchestration
  - from internal optimization to external interaction
  - from a focus on customer value to a focus on ecosystem value
- competitive threats for platform business
  - an established platform with superior network effects that uses its relationships with customers to enter your industry
  - a competitor may target an overlapping customer base with a distinctive new offering that leverages network effects
  - platforms that collect the same type of data that your firm does suddenly go after your market, is still emerging
- success of platform strategy is determined by
  - **Connections**: how easily others can plug into the platform to share and transact
  - **Gravity**: How well the platform attracts participants, both producers and consumers
  - **Flow**: how well the platform fosters the exchange and cocreation of value
- three building blocks of successful platform
  - **Magnet**
    - create pull that attracts participants to the platform with a kind of social gravity
    - for transaction platforms, both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass
    - platform builders must pay attention to the design of incentives, reputation systems, and pricing models. They must also leverage social media to harness the network effect for rapid growth
  - **Toolbox（开发者工具）**
    - create connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform. This infrastructure enables interactions between participants(for developer)
  - **Matchmakers（推荐算法）**
    - fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers
    - data is at the heart of successful matchmaking, and distinguished platform from other business models
    - captures rich data about the participants and leverages that data to facilitate connection between producers and consumers
  - not all platform place the same emphasis on all three building blocks
- challenges in adopting platform strategy
  - trust
  - legal
  - security
