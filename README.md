## Literature Reviews

I was firstly inspired by the "Kotter 1995 HBR" and found out the basic concepts to work on. In order to judge those eight concepts that Mr. Kotter had proposed, I searched lots of journals and chapters of book for supporting and criticising those concepts. Among all these papers, they have illustrated numerous different kinds of failure when implementing changes. Some of them may fail at the beginning and some of them are just approximately close to the success. Generally, six out of eight different kinds of factor that have been highlighted and mentioned multiple times. The rest two concepts were a little bit missing supportive evidence according to my researching.  In this section, those six concepts will be broken down for further summary, explanation and discussion. 

**Fail to establish Business Vision**

The concepts firstly mentioned by Kotter in 1995. It is describing that transformation without a clear vision will be easily losing its direction. Project without a certain purpose will be confusing by the employees. Thus, all these contributions will be work on a meaningless way. In book 'Break through IT change management', planning ahead for change and researching on industry is necessary as a part of implementing a successful transformation(Bennet P. , 2004). It also discuss the key value of the plan and strategy by many other authors. To establish the business vision properly, it is essential to understand the business scope and process of the company. Fully utilizing and optimizing the scoping problems would be a fast way to identify and locate our future business vision. It also concludes the concerns of manager level and employees (Paul Harmon, 2007). In many cases, this factor is regarding as the most vital issues. There are lots of enterprise are blindly follow the market trend and changing themselves where most of them are failed to succeed the change. Neglecting the importance of their own business goal and process is not able to survive the transformation. 

**Lack sense of Urgency** 

There are several journals have mentioned this concept. Even though there are companies that blindly follow the trend, there are still such companies that are satisfying with their current states and ignoring the market effect and environment. In merchant industry, several large enterprises were insisting their business model and unrealized that they were already gaining pressures from small efficient retailers (Patricia, S, 1988). In this case, companies may lose their most valuable assets if they are not taking actions. In journal “Stakeholder expectations for environmental performance within the apparel industry: the urgency of business response” mentioned that assessing the urgency and intensity of their demands for transformation to improve the environment performance should be taken seriously by the stakeholders (Dickson, 2012). Otherwise, it may cost uncountably tangible and intangible loss. Stakeholders have prominent roles in decisions making. It is also important for them to realize the urgency of taking change and then, leading the company for further practice (Myllykangas, Kujala, & Lehtimäki, 2010). 

**Lack of Communication**

In a failed change, failure can be attribute to lack communicating (Kotter, J. P. ,1995). It has been recorded that over 75 per cent of failed transformations are attributed to the problem of lacking communicating during the process. Roy Jakes, IS director of Guiness Global Support and team leader, has mentioned that the key during the changing period was the communication and it still is (Mark Collyer, 2000). Communication has 4 general roles in strategic organizational change. It can reduce the uncertainty of employees who are participating in the transformations; It can overcome the resistance inside the company and guiding them to embrace the change; It can facilitating employees participations by creating trusting and open atmosphere; It can build up shared understanding and mutual interpretation between the management and employees (Men, Bowen, & Burton).  

**Avoid Moving onto New Vision**

There are several reasons contribute to this issue. In terms of organisational structure, narrow job categories can be one of the reason why employees refuse to embrace new change. They were afraid of losing their current position when new changes happened. In terms of compensation or performance-appraisal systems, people were bothering whether to choose the new vision or their own self-interest (Kotter, J. P. ,1995). These are attributed to the financial barriers which involve money and often are the most difficult barriers to overcome (Kelley, B. 2016).  In terms of business model, there are internal barriers and external barriers. Internal barriers consist of lack of resources and external barriers consist of lack of demands (Herbes. C, 2017). In this case, even though the company are urgent to change, they are not able to do so since their shortage of demand and resources are not allowed them to change.  In terms of employee themselves, some of them may believe in creativity is the least thing they need. They are the one on control of their own change and they won't do so if they don't see any need for improvement (Gogatz. A, 2005). 

**Not Establishing Short-Term Wins**

It will easily lose momentum during transformation especially the long-term change. Thus, establishing short-term wins are able to encourage the employees and the process of change to some degree (Kotter, J. P. ,1995). By improving short-term financial performance for motivating the employees is one of the recommended traditional approaches (Jones. R. G. ,2017). In some case, short-term wins are promoting long-term success by showing that each phase was well performed and excellently finished (Keith, B. 2016). 

**Declaring Victory Too Soon**

In some failed transformation cases, announcing the victory without the solid foundation of supporting the post-change situation would lead to the collapse of the whole infrastructure.
