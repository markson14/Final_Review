Our solution is to provide a smart contact lens called Era, which is short for education resources accessing and it is also a new era of smart contact lenses.

Let's firstly have a look at the current market of smart contact lenses. It is still a niche market so far with the market value of approximately 4.5 billion dollar.  Hopefully, it would increase to 7.2 billion in 2023. 

As you can see, there are four leading company that are working on products with this technology. Google is the first player in this market in 2014. They firstly focus on the health industry. The basic functions are using the lenses for monitoring the glucose level with tear analysing. It also has many supplementary functions such as focus adjusting and video showing. Sensimed SA. Is an medical technology oriented company. Their contact lenses use more advanced methods and algorithms for detecting eyes' diseases. Samsung and Sony were also releasing resembling smart contact lenses afterward.

Let take Google and sensimed SA as examples. Google is the first movers of this market, designing the standard technology and principle of this industry. They established a well-developed platform for receiving feedback  and further improvement. In terms of Sensimend SA, even though they have much more advanced technology and more specific purpose for their products, they are ignoring the distributed strategies and becoming infamous since they are not providing a community or feedback channel for the users. Only a few people who working on this industry are able to know them. 

Our ERA lenses are basically consist of three main aspects. Lenses itself, well-developed community and extension of web api. Firstly, it is a wearable screen. It can also interacting with the reality by recognise the world features and overlay images onto it. All the functions can be control by your eye motions in our first stage product. Later we may have a trial on brain-implanted sensor for brain computer interaction. Moreover, it can access to the university libraries or even browsing the social-media. We will provide a well-established community platform for user to exchange their information and communicating with each others. We also provide toolkits for developer to develop their own api that can be used by our contact lenses. It may somehow improve our product and borden its usage. 

these are the technology that supporting our era lens. we are modifying the existed product which produced by Samsung. Integrating with micro camera, eye motion detect sensor and microprocessor into the lenses. Web API is the most important extension support for our products. we are hoping using the user innovation to improve our product to some degree. Last but not least, we are using the tear power to drive our lenses. It is a cutting-edge technology and have already been proven its feasibility.

here are some changes that our product can bring to you. first is the efficient interaction by your eye motion. you can also choose which part to record in the lecture by sending motion message to your lenses. you can access it to the internet as long as you have the signal just like your smartphone. the community provides you with lots of the study materials and saving your cost on the books and papers.
