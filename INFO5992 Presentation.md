Our solution is the smart contact lens called Era, which is short for education resources accessing and it is also a new era of smart contact lenses.

Let's firstly have a look at the current market of smart contact lenses. It is still a niche market in 2016 with the market value of approximately 4.5 billion dollar.  Hopefully, it would increase to 7.2 billion in 2023. 

As you can see, there are four leading company that are working on products with this technology. Google is the first player in this market in 2014. They firstly focus on the health industry. The google lenses is used for monitoring the glucose level by tear analysing. It also has many supplementary functions such as focus adjusting and video showing. Samsung and Sony were also releasing resembling smart contact lenses afterward. Sensimed SA is a medical technology oriented company. Their contact lenses use more specific methods and algorithms for detecting eyes' diseases. 

Let take Google and Sensimed SA as examples. Google is the first mover of this market, designing the standard technology and principle of this industry. They established a well-developed platform for receiving feedback and further improvement. In terms of Sensimed SA, even though they have much more advanced technology and more specific purpose for their products, they are ignoring the distributed strategies and therefore, becoming infamous since they are not providing a community or feedback channel for the users. 

Our ERA lenses are basically consist of three main aspects. Lenses itself, well-developed community and extension of web api. Firstly, it is a wearable screen. It can also interacting with the reality by recognise the world features and overlay images onto it. All the functions can be control by your eye motions in our first stage product. Later we may have a trial on brain-implanted sensor for brain computer interaction. Moreover, it can access to the university libraries or even browsing the social-media. We will provide a well-established community platform for user to exchange their information and communicating with each others. We also provide toolkits for developer to develop their own api that can be used by our contact lenses. It may somehow improve our product and borden its usage. 

these are the technology that supporting our era lens. we are modifying the existed product which produced by Samsung, Integrating with micro camera, eye motion detect sensor and microprocessor. Web API is the most important technology for extension that supporting our products. we are hoping using the user innovation to improve our product to some degree. Last but not least, we are using the tear power to drive our lenses. It is a cutting-edge technology and have already been proven its feasibility.

here are some changes that our product can bring to you. first is the efficient interaction by your eye motion. you can choose which part to record in the lecture by sending motion message to your lenses. you can access it to the internet as long as you have the signal just like your smartphone. the community provides you with lots of existing study materials and save your searching time. Digital materials and resources can also save your cost on the physical books and papers.
